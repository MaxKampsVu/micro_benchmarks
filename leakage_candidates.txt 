Good candidates:
- sram remnant (discuss)
- register/sram overwrite 
- register neighbour leakage 
- leakage of neighbouring sram cells (miracle)
- leakage of operands in Instructions of the pipeline (miracle)

Bad candidates:
- Different alignment access of memory (miracle)
    - Once the allignemnt of memory has been specified in scVerif, it can only be accessed with the specified allignemnt
- Branching in pipeline (miracle)
    - We observe leakage with instruction that should not be executed (but are anyways executed in the pipeline). 
    - Will be difficult to model in scVerif 
- Speculative execution in pipeline (miracle)
    - Again we observe leakage with instructions which should not be executed
